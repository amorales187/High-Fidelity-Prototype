### Brief Summary: Purposes and Process

- This is a high-fidelity testing of the OutWrite Magazine website. The website prototype is created by Figma. The purpose of the testing is to examine the functions of three features (one added based on revision) designed based on the persona, Shu Li, Jack Wang, and Tim Benson. This high-fidelity prototype is transformed from the low-fidelity hand-drawn prototype with improved graphic elements, UI material components, and features. 

- The process takes place in terms of three full sequences of website activities users can perform on the website (through the prototype). The first sequence is developed based on persona Jack Wang. The first step of the sequence is to go to the Help page, then learn how to use the Search button-through reading the instructions on the help page, then approach the Search button through the home bar on the Help page, then go to the home page through clicking on “HOME” on the home bar. The second sequence is designed for Shu Li, an international student who tries to find international resources for support within the LGBTQ community. The entire process takes four steps: 1. Navigate COMMUNITY on the home bar; 2. Click to see the options on the dropdown menu; 3. Go to the International community page by clicking on “International”. 4. Go back to the home page by clicking on “HOME” on the home bar. The third sequence is created based on persona Tim Benson. The entire activity takes three steps to finish: 1. Go to the About page by clicking on “ABOUT” on the home bar (in my persona’s situation, he would read through the information about the organization); 2. Go to the Contact page by clicking on “CONTACT US” on the home bar. 3. Go back to the home page by clicking on “HOME” on the home bar.

### Interactive Prototypes Supported by the System

- Find information through the Help page that support users, especially first-time users to navigate information more efficiently

- An International subpage under COMMUNITY. This page helps international students to find news and support on a global scope

- To learn more about OutWrite through browsing on the About page for promoting the organization as well as facilitating with marketing and outreach. 

- To navigate specific information, topics or items in an efficient manner through using the Search interactive hover box. 

- A HOME button on the home bar that reassure the visitors that they can go back to the original page anytime they want, and that they are at the right place.

#### Color

- The graphical interface design process went smoothly because the published version of the OutWrite Magazine website already has an established and consistent outlook, and thus when I was creating the prototype, I primarily followed the constructed color theme, layout, and graphical elements, but with a few changes. First of all, the OutWrite website has an abundant amount of visual assets – illustrations, thumbnail pictures, and photos. Thus, for a relatively simple and clean outlook, I choose to stick with three colors: 1. The color of “OUT” from the logo #E8228C; 2. Black #000000; and 3. The gray color, #F5F5F5. However, I encountered a problem when I was checking with color contrast: the color of “OUT” and the gray color both fail to qualify for at least 4.5:1 ratio with the white background (#FFFFFF). Thus, I changed the saturation of both colors to get a slightly darker version of these two colors for a higher color contrast.

- On the right top corner on the home page, there are five distinctive buttons with different colors. I chose these colors from the graphics exhibited on the homepage for visual consistency. Additionally, I keep the original color of the Facebook application icon and Twitter icon to reassure users of the functionality of these two buttons. I did not choose to keep the color of the Instagram application as it conflicts with the pink color in the logo. Instead, I changed it to a pale/low-saturated green color to avoid too much color conflict within the color design.

#### Image and Icons

- For most pages, I keep the original imagery choices (example: article listing and their thumbnails) For the About page specifically, I designed and added a few pictures I found through UCLA affiliated imagery stock and online sources.  I chose these four immersive images because they all contain the same element – the rainbow flag, which represents the LGBTQ community. I choose to put three pictures on top, one on the bottom with the illustration in between to maintain a visual balance.

- In addition, to add more images to the website, I also noticed that the website does not fully take advantage of website icons. For example, there are no social media icons exhibited on the page. Thus I added a few easily understandable icons to the header, such as the icon for search, help and social media outlets, so even novice-users would know which functions to use when they first visit the website. 

#### Typography

- For typography, I also followed the original font exhibited on the original website. Since there is no information about the font used by the original website, I used an online font detector before choosing fonts and found a few font styles that the OutWrite Magazine website possibly uses. I narrowed down the style to Times New Roman font and tried to search the font on Figma first, but unfortunately, the application does not offer such a font. Then I searched for fonts similar to Times New Roman font and found a font named Lora that appears largely akin to Times New Roman. For readability, I chose to keep using one font on the website, but with different sizes, colors and capitalizations to distinguish title and body text.
